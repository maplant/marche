    Items should have a programmable chance of having a given attribute, as we
    want to be able to change these values.

** Item types
   We should add more item types

* Threads 
** Thread reading
   Reading threads should be enjoyable and never overwhelming.
*** TODO Auto link external links in posts   
*** TODO Add pagination to threads
    I'm not completely sure we actually want pagination, but if we do we would
    want to do the following: 
    - [ ] Add pagination to thread
    - [ ] Add last viewed page to reading history
    Questions:
    - How many threads should there be on a page? 
*** TODO Add page navigation buttons
    Buttons that go to the top and bottom of the page
** Posting
*** TODO Allow editing of posts

* Administration
** TODO Admins can edit any post
** TODO Admins can ban any user for any length
** TODO Mods can ban users for some length
